# Cyber Security Projects

### PROJECT !
### Password Generator Using Python 

#### Description:
A Password Generator helps users generate strong, secure passwords to enhance their cybersecurity practices. This project uses Python to create a script that generates random passwords with customizable length and complexity. The password generator can include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters to ensure robust password strength.

#### Key Features:
**Customizable Length:** Users can specify the length of the password.
**Password Complexity:** Users can choose to include lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.
**Strong Randomization:** The password is generated using Python’s secrets library to ensure cryptographically secure randomness.
**Password Strength:** The generated password meets common password complexity standards.

#### Technologies Used:
* Python (using secrets for secure randomization)
* Jupyter Notebook (to interactively test and visualize the password generation).

#### Cybersecurity Significance: 
This project ensures that users generate strong passwords, which are a critical part of securing online accounts and systems. The randomness and complexity of the password help mitigate brute-force and dictionary attacks.
